# Partner Jenkins Pipeline Operation Instruction

## Objective

This document provides instructions for partners to create their own customized menu for the Jenkins pipeline and to run Microsoft-provided tests and/or customized test cases in Jenkins. This instruction has 2 major parts; creating the menu from xml files and executing the tests. Creating a custom menu may be optional for your test development. If you keep the same menu structure and add new tests into existing the menu, you will only update the existing XML files in **./XML/TestCases/**

If you add a custom test menu, you will need to re-build the Jenkins menu, and then can run new tests.

## Develop tests in GitHub

`Source: https://github.com/LIS/LISAv2`

    1. ./XML folder: pre-defined global configuration and account information as well as Region information. 
        This folder also has two sub folders; 'TestCases' and 'VMConfigurations'. 'VMConfigurations' has the 
        list of xml files for each test case, which require the list of VM configuration information. 
        'TestCases' folder has the list of xml files for each test category. The master branch is owned by 
        Microsoft, and actively manage changes in LISAv2. New test case development and/or new menu 
        development must be approved by Microsoft.
    2. 'Testscripts' folder has the number of test scripts used in TestCases, and separated by OS type.
    3. 'Tools' folder has binary files required for test execution.
    4. This repo will provide Microsoft-provided test cases as well as capability of Partner-developed test cases.
        a. Microsoft will share the test development plan and its log with partners. If you only execute 
            Microsoft-provided tests, you can skip the next paragraph to ‘Verify a published image on Azure’.
        b. Partner-developed test cases should follow these steps:
            i.   Sync up the local 'master' branch from remote 'master' branch in the GitHub project, 
                 if new work branch is in the LISAv2. Otherwise, you can folk the LISAv2 repo to your own GitHub 
                 account.
            ii.  Branch out for work and pull down to your local system.
            iii. Once change is ready to review, create a Pull Request from LISAv2 in your account to LIS account. 
                 Or, new working branch to master in LISAv2 repo.
            iv.  Add ‘LisaSupport@microsoft.com’ to ‘Reviewers’, or send email to 'lisasupport@microsoft.com'.
            v.   Once it is approved, you can merge the Pull Request to master branch. In this case, you will need 
                 to rebuild menu by ‘<Partner name>-Refresh-Test-Selection-Menus’.

## Verify a published image on Azure

`Web Browser Instructions`

        1. Sign into Jenkins page with the assigned username & password
        2. Browse to '<Partner name>-Refresh-Test-Selection-Menu', if you would like to apply new menu or test cases 
           before test execution.
        3. Click 'Build with Parameters' in left panel menu
            a. Enter the git repo URL and branch name of new menu's xml file. We recommend keeping the default Repo 
               URL and branch name.
            b. Click 'Build' button.
            c. Click the working icon of the running job in 'Build History' and verify "SUCCESS" via 'Console Output' 
               details. You have new menu/test cases in Jenkins.
        4. Browse to '<Partner name>-Launch-Tests' and submit the job for test execution.
        5. Click 'Build with Parameters' in left panel menu
            a. Select 'ImageSource' or navigate to 'CustomVHD'. If you have external source URL, you can enter it in 
               'CustomVHDURL' text box.
            b. Leave 'Kernel' unless you would like to change to customized kernel code or linux-next.
            c. Update the 3 options regarding how to select test cases; TestName, Category and Tag.
                i. Supported platform: Azure, etc.
                ii. Available Category: BVT, Community, Functional, Performance, and Smoke.
                iii. Available Tags: boot, bvt, disk, ext4, gpu, hv_netvsc, etc.
        6. Enter partner's email address for report notification.
        

`API/cmdline Instruction`

A single script executes the test launch/execute with pre-defined parameters. It also offers a parameter file mode, which all parameters are set before execution. The test script loads all paramenters from the file. The parameter file is located at **./Utilities/TestParameters.sh**
